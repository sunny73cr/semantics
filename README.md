## Minimising stack exchange; program correctness, code correctness

## Reducing the reverse-ability of code via static analysis

## Bad practices in the industry!

What the hell is wrong with sharing a public TLS certificate?

## Correcting... CPU's?

## Correcting... Stanford University?

Note.. if this is a real error (and not a TLS certificate hack), you can happily claim the reward for yourself.
